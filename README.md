# Titanic
 The required Titanic Project you have to do before they can call you a Data Scientist.
 
 In all seriousness, I've wanted to enter a kaggle competition for a long time and this seemed like a great place to start.
 
 ## Project Overview:
 - Currently at only 74% accuracy on the testing set. Work is ongoing to get into the 80s.
 - Data was acquired from the ongoing kaggle competition [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
 - Extensive EDA and feature engineering. 
 - Use of Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Clustering.
 - Hyperparameter optimization with GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
 - Hot takes on James Cameron Movies.
 
 ## Code and Resources Used:
 **Python Version:** 3.7
 **Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, lightgbm
